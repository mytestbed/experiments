Public Repository of OEDL experiments
=====================================

This repository holds examples of OEDL experiments that were developed and executed with OMF 6.

Each OEDL file in this repo should have at its top some description of its related experiment (e.g. context, requirements, scenario, etc...).

Everyone is welcomed to contribute experiment descriptions to this repo, e.g. via pull-requests or via our omf-user mailing listi (https://lists.nicta.com.au/wws/info/omf-user).
